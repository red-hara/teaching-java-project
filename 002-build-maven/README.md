# Building with Maven

Ant is pretty good, but soon developers have noticed that:
1. Some operations are repeated from project to project the same way;
2. They need a way to use dependencies in a more centralised manner.

Maven allows one to specify the build process in the `pom.xml` file.
There are various default goals like `compile`, `package` or `test`.
Nice Maven addition to the build process is plugin system, allowing developer to use external plugins and packages.

Maven is more opinionated than Ant, by default it requires specific project directory.
Note that `Demo.java` source file is now located in `src/main/java` directory.
Also, the `target` directory is created automatically too!

Let's run the `compile` target:

```
mvn compile
```

The compiled `Demo.class` is located in `target/classes` directory.
To run it execute the following command:

```
java -cp ./target/classes Demo
```

Just as with Ant, Maven's `pom.xml` may be generated by the Integrated Development Environment.
