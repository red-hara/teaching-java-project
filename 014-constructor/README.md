# Constructor

_Constructor_ is a method, called upon Class instance creation with the `new` syntax.
Constructors provide way to initialize the instance's fields upon its creation.

```.java
Object something = new Object();
```

If there are multiple constructors defined, the one with proper signature is called.

## Running this example:

```
mvn package
java -jar target/constructor-0.0.1.jar
```
